            <li><b>Risk Upon Arrival:</b> Travelers, especially those having just arrived in [@country], are often targets of crime and at higher risk of harm, because they:
                <ol>
                    <li>Are unfamiliar with their surroundings</li>
                    <li>Might not speak [@countryPrimaryLanguage] or the local language well</li>

                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><img src="images/country_img/risk_bad.gif" alt="warning" style="float:right; margin:4px;" /><b>Keeping In Control:</b> In addition to the circumstances involved with being new in a foreign country like [@country], there maybe circumstances which are often beyond one's immediate control. There are many situations that students can control. Some controllable factors that place students at greatest risk include:
                <ol>
                    <li>Being out after midnight</li>
                    <li>Being alone at night in an isolated area</li>
                    <li>Being in a known high crime area</li>
                    <li>Sleeping in an unlocked place</li>
                    <li>Being out after a local curfew</li>
                    <li>Being under the influence of alcohol or drugs.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><b>Verbal and Non&ndash;verbal Communication:</b> Non&ndash;verbal communication (like body language and hand gestures) considered harmless in the U.S. may be offensive to people in [@country] and other countries to which you plan to travel. The list of gestures considered rude in other countries can grow beyond the obvious. For more help communicating in [@country], please see the Communication Sheets.</li>
            <li><b>Sexually Transmitted Diseases:</b> Keep yourself free from sexually transmitted diseases by using protection (like condoms or abstinence). Also, remember that "no" may not always be interpreted as "no" in [@country] and in other countries. Inform yourself about the types of diseases prevalent in the area in which you are studying and the areas in which you will be traveling.</li>
            <li><img src="images/country_img/risk_info.gif" alt="info" style="float:right; margin:4px;" /><b>International Sources of Information:</b> Inform yourself as much as possible about your new environment, making use of as many different sources as possible &ndash; online, in the library, on television and radio news programs, and in the paper. Don't limit yourself to U.S. sources. Instead, contrast the U.S. information with that provided by [@country] and other countries. Please see "Media" in the Resources section of this Handbook.</li>
            <li><b>Understanding Locals:</b> Beyond tuning into yourself, make it a point to try to understand what locals are communicating to you, how they feel about you and about U.S. citizens in general, how you are fitting with their values, and how well you understand them. Obviously a stronger grasp of the official language(s) will help you with these things, but even knowing a few essential phrases can be immensely beneficial. Please see the Communication Sheets of this Handbook for Helpful Words and Phrases you should know.</li>
            <li><img src="images/country_img/risk_dress.gif" alt="warning" style="float:right; margin:4px;" /><b>How to Dress:</b> It is often best to dress conservatively &ndash; by local standards, so you can't be identified on sight as a tourist or a U.S. citizen.</li>
            <li><b>Jewelry and Other Valuables:</b> Be cautious with how you display valuables (does it look like you're flaunting wealth?). Leave your good jewelry at home, and keep money in a safe place like a money belt or hidden pouch under your clothes.</li>
            <li><b>Becoming Aware of Your Surroundings:</b> You should be aware of your surroundings, remembering to:
                <ol>
                    <li>Pay attention to what people around you are saying</li>
                    <li>Find out which areas of the city are less safe than others</li>
                    <li>Know which hours of night are considered more dangerous</li>
                    <li>Stay and walk only in well&ndash;lit areas</li>
                    <li>Avoid being alone in unfamiliar neighborhoods</li>
                    <li>Know where to get help (police station, fire station, phones, stores, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Do not touch suspicious items like letters or packages mailed to you from someone you don't know</li>
                    <li>Know what is "normal" and "not normal" to see on a daily basis in the areas you frequent</li>
                    <li>Do not respond to explosions or gunfire by going to a window; seek cover away from windows and exterior walls</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><b>Political Rallies</b>: Avoid political rallies, which can increase tensions and emotions or breed angry mobs for which a U.S. citizen may serve as a scapegoat.</li>
            <li><b>Political Conversations</b>: Try not to engage in conversations about contentious political issues with locals and avoid retaliating against hostile or bigoted remarks about Americans.</li>
        </ul>
