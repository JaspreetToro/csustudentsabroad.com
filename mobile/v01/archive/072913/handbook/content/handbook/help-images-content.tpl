  <p>You may find it helpful to print and cut out our Service Icons Card that you can carry with you. The card contains a series of simple images that represent services you may require—services like a telephone, post&ndash;office, taxi, and hospital. If you don&#39;t remember, or don&#39;t know, how to say a certain word in the language of the country where you are studying, you can point to the picture on the card that represents that word. For example, if you need to find a telephone, you can show someone the picture of a telephone on the card and they can assist you. It is better to already be able to comfortably communicate in the language of the country in which you will be studying. However, you should keep this card with you just in case you forget how to say a certain word, or, in the case of injury, you become physically unable to verbally communicate.</p>
