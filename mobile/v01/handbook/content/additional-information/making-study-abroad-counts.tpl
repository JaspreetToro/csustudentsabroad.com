        <h2><a name="section10"></a>10.  Checklist</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I am already familiar with some major cultural differences between home and the country of your choice.</li>
            <li>I understand that it is normal to experience reverse culture shock, including feelings of anxiety, depression and frustration towards home and the United States.</li>
            <li>If my depression does not go away, I know where to get help (i.e.: a student counselor)?</li>
            <li>I expect to have both good days and bad when learning to overcome my reverse culture shock, and I will be patient with myself as I learn to adapt back to life in the United States.</li>
            <li>I know that I am not alone in how I feel.</li>
            <li>I will try not to be negative or overly critical of United States or a citizen of the country of your choice culture. Instead, I will look for the positives that a culture possesses.</li>
            <li>Upon return home, I will be patient with myself again as I experience reverse culture shock. (This includes trying not to be overly critical of the U.S. just because being home is not like being abroad.)</li>
        </ul>
