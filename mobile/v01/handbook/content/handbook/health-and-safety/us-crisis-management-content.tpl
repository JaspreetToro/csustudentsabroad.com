        <p>Most students returning from study abroad say that it was one of the most valuable parts of their college or university experience. However, similar to the realities on a U.S. campus, there may be a few students who encounter a minor or major emergency while abroad in [@country]. Many study abroad programs have developed comprehensive support strategies. The first place to start getting information about your program's support strategies is in your study abroad advisor's office in the United States and your program director's office in [@country]. We have also provided the following resources: <a href="../emergency-card.php?country=General">Emergency Card</a>, <a href="personal-emergency-action-plan.php?country=General">Personal Emergency Action Plan</a>, <a href="emergency-action-plan-steps.php?country=General">Emergency Action Plan Steps</a>, to assist you in being prepared before going and after arriving in [@country].</p>
        <h2><a name="section1"></a>1.  Minor and Major Emergencies</h2>
        <img src="images/country_img/crisis_storm.gif" alt="Minor and Major Emergencies" style="float:right; margin:4px;" />
        <p>While most students experience a safe and healthy time abroad, some are forced to deal with minor emergencies. However, what students consider a minor emergency here at home can turn into a more difficult to handle situation abroad in [@country]. Small emergencies abroad can seem like larger ones due to language and communication barriers, and a lack of familiarity with foreign surroundings. Some of the minor emergencies students have faced abroad in [@country] included illnesses like diarrhea and heatstroke, and crimes like petty theft and mugging.</p>
        <p>In addition to minor emergencies, some students may also face larger emergencies while in [@country]. Frequently, these major emergencies tend to be events out of a student's control. Some unpredictable, major emergencies that could occur abroad include: natural disasters like earthquakes and hurricanes, acts of terrorism, and serious medical problems.</p>
        <h2><a name="section2"></a>2.  Things To Do Before a Crisis Occurs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Emergency Action Plan:</b> The first step in crisis management is being prepared before a crisis occurs. Consider adopting a personal Emergency Action Plan (EAP) for yourself. Essentially, this document describes what actions to take in the event of an emergency. Your EAP could be as simple as a list of people to call in case you are hurt, along with copies of your insurance papers, passport, and names of any medications to which you are allergic. Please see the Emergency Planning section for how to create a personal EAP, and steps to take during an emergency.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p> <b>Why Create an EAP?</b> </p>
                        <img src="images/country_img/crisis_idea.gif" alt="Minor and Major Emergencies" style="float:right; margin:4px;" />
                        <p> The more support networks you have during an emergency or crisis, the more likely someone will be available to help you. Also, the better prepared you are ahead of time, the better chance you have of responding effectively to a crisis in [@country]. Therefore, it is important to set&ndash;up support networks, and an EAP, before an emergency occurs&ndash;before you actually need assistance. Creating an EAP is a good first step towards keeping yourself healthy and safe in the event of an emergency or crisis while in [@country]. </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p> <b>Who Needs a Copy of Your EAP?</b> </p>
                        <p> We remind you to give copies of your EAP to your contacts in [@country], and leave copies with appropriate contacts at home, which may include several family members and friends. Make sure to always keep a copy on hand for yourself as well. You should consider giving your EAP to the following contacts: </p>
                        <p> In Home: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Your primary home emergency contact </li>
                            <li> Power of Attorney </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> In [@country]: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Your primary emergency contact (which can be your international student coordinator)
                            <li>Residence Assistant/home-stay family member(s)/roommate(s)
                            <li>Friends or family in the U.S.
                            <li>Yourself
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p> <b>How to Create an EAP</b> </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> <b>Getting to You:</b> Ideally, try to develop detailed written directions so that someone would be able to locate you at your study abroad location in [@country], or travel location(s), in the event of an emergency. You may want to draw visual aids or maps in addition to writing out instructions. </li>
                            <li> <b>Getting Yourself Out:</b> Then, try to develop detailed instructions for yourself, showing possible routes from your place of residence, hotel/hostel, work/internship and/or university/program in [@country] to a safe place. You may also want to include other places that you frequent, including shops, restaurants, subway stations, nightclubs, etc. You may want to draw visual aids or include a copy of a map in addition to writing out instructions. </li>
                            <li> <b>Things to Consider:</b> Remember, elevators may not function, and electric doors may not open in the event of an emergency; make sure to map out escape routes in which you take the stairs (or wheelchair ramps) rather than elevators. Consider carrying a small flashlight with you at all times in case the lights go out and you need to find your way through dark hallways or stairwells. Phone lines may also go down, so don't rely on calling someone to come pick you up. Have your Emergency/First Aid Kit available to take with you. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><img src="images/country_img/crisis_woman.gif" alt="Minor and Major Emergencies" style="float:right; margin:4px;" /><b>Injury:</b> Prior to departure or immediately upon arrival in [@country], you should identify appropriate medical facilities in case of injury abroad. It is important to know whether your travel insurance will pay in advance for care, or whether you will need to apply for reimbursement. In the case of injury, the U.S. Bureau of Consular Affairs can assist your family in sending you the necessary funds to pay for your medical care. In some instances they can help arrange for your transport and accompaniment back home, although they won't pay for this.</li>
            <li><b>Serious Emergencies:</b>  Natural disasters, political upheaval, and terrorism are some of the events the U.S. State Department considers to be serious emergencies or crises.  When they occur, your university officials will relate a plan of action, which all students should follow as well as additional support information. If you are not sure about the situation, contact your international student coordinator immediately.</li>
            <li><b>Death:</b> In the event of your death in the U.S., your institution will locate and inform your next of kin and relay special instructions for the disposition or burial of your remains. Details about the repatriations of your remains may be included in your medical insurance.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="section3"></a>3.  Who Can Help You?</h2>
        <img src="images/country_img/crisis_clipboard.gif" alt="Who Can Help You" style="float:right; margin:4px;" />
        <ul>
            <li><b>What Your U.S. University Can Do:</b>This differs from institution to institution. The staff and administrators of your university/institution can only do so much to ensure your safety. Ultimately, it is your responsibility to keep college or international student services staff well informed of your whereabouts, travel plans, needs, health problems, safety concerns, etc. By telling college or university staff about your needs and activities, you can greatly reduce possible risks to your safety. While you can, and should, always ask your international student services staff for assistance, they might not always be able to help you.</li>
            <li style="list-style: none"><img src="images/country_img/crisis_tommy.gif" alt="Keeping Yourself Safe" style="float:right; margin:4px;" /></li>
            <li><b>Keeping Yourself Safe:</b>  The student participants themselves can have a major impact on their own health and safety abroad through the decisions they make before and during their study, and by their day-to-day choices and behaviors. Parents, Guardians and Families: Parents, guardians, and families can also play an important role in the health and safety of international students. They are often the major lifeline to home and can help students make decisions, or encourage appropriate behavior while in the U.S. Even though studying in the U.S. is a time of great independence for students, the student's parents, guardians and family members should not be left in the dark about their student's activities. <a href="http://www.nafsa.org/resourcelibrary/default.aspx?id=16949">Good Practices for Health and Safety</a> lists six suggestions for parents and guardians.
