        <h2><a name="section2"></a>2. Travel Safety [@country]</h2>
        <p><strong>Planning for a Healthy and Safe Time [@country]</strong>: Preparation for your time [@country] should include an understanding of the current political, cultural and religious events of the country as well as the region, and an awareness of the social climate. Students are advised to be alert to their surroundings, and be particularly aware of any health and safety advisories for the areas in which they will be studying.</p>

        <h2><a name="section3"></a>3. Important Health and Safety Issues</h2>
        <p>Visit this page to see the top ten health and safety issues you should be aware of before you depart for [@country] and the other countries to which you may be traveling.</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:decimal;">
            <li><img src="images/country_img/health_needles.gif" alt="Needles" style="float:right; margin:4px;" /><strong>Illnesses, Diseases, and Inoculations:</strong> Find out about the various illnesses that might be more common [@country] or the regions and countries to which you will be traveling. Get the appropriate shots and pills, and take the appropriate medications with you if your doctor thinks it's necessary. Find out about any potential side&ndash;effects of shots and pills that you may take. For information on illnesses that may be prevalent [@country], please see the CDC link in the <a href="http://studentsabroad.com/handbook/resources.php?country=[@country_resources]">Resources</a> section of this Handbook.</li>
            <li><strong>Physicals and Check&ndash;ups:</strong> Get a complete physical, eye exam and dental check&ndash;up before going to [@country]. While health care is generally good [@country], the quality of dental and medical care might be different in the various countries or regions you may visit. Also, they could possibly be more expensive than similar care in the United States.</li>
            <li><img src="images/country_img/health_water.gif" alt="Water" style="float:right; margin:4px;" /><strong>Can You Drink the Water?:</strong> Find out if water is generally safe to drink in different regions of [@country] and in the countries to which you will be traveling. To avoid diarrhea and other bacteria, purify questionable water before you drink it. Make sure water bottles come sealed when you buy them. Remember that ice can also be unsafe, as well as the water you use to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li><strong>Food Safety:</strong> If you get diarrhea or food poisoning, remember to drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. As with any illness, consider seeing a doctor if your condition worsens. Give your body time to adjust to new types of foods you will be eating.</li>
            <li><strong>Laws and Codes of Conduct:</strong> Make yourself aware of both the rules and regulations of your study abroad program sponsor, and the local laws and customs of [@country] and the countries which you will be visiting. Understand that you will not only have to conform to the legal system of [@country], but also obey the codes of conduct required of program participants. Also recognize that certain laws may vary from region to region or even city to city.</li>
            <li><img src="images/country_img/health_head.gif" alt="Mental and Physical Health" style="float:right; margin:4px;" /><strong>Mental and Physical Health:</strong> Consider your own mental and physical health issues when applying for a study abroad program, and make all your necessary health information available to your program's administrators in the U.S. and abroad so they can assist you with any special needs, or advise you on the risks you might face. Study abroad may include both physical and mental challenges for students, so make sure you establish a support network of program administrators, family and friends who can help you. According to the U.S. Department of State, "Good medical care is widely available."</li>
            <li><img src="images/country_img/health_firstaid.gif" alt="First Aid Kit" style="float:right; margin:4px;" /><strong>Prescriptions:</strong> To be cautious, get a doctor's signed prescription for any medication you have to bring with you to [@country], and get it translated into [@country]. However, if you can, take a supply large enough to cover your stay while abroad, just in case you can&#39;t fill your prescription while abroad. Contact the U.S. Embassy [@country] or your program administrator/advisor to find out if and how much U.S. prescription medication is allowed into [@country]. Also include a copy of your prescription for your glasses or contact lenses. Bring an extra pair of glasses.</li>
            <li><strong>First&ndash;Aid Kit:</strong> Consider a well&ndash;stocked first&ndash;aid kit as a first line of defense. Some items to include are: sunscreen, bandages, flashlight, sterile pads, insect repellent, adhesive tape, aspirin, antacid, anti&ndash;diarrhea tablets, anti&ndash;malarial medication, extra bottled water, feminine protection, condoms, rubber gloves, etc.</li>
            <li><img src="images/country_img/health_shoe.gif" alt="Fitness" style="float:right; margin:4px;" /><strong>Fitness and Exercise:</strong> Try to get fit in the time you have before departing for [@country]. A healthy body can help you fight off illness and recover faster if you do get sick. Even though it may be harder to follow a structured workout routine, try to stay fit while [@country]. Exercise also helps to increase energy levels and combat depression. Get a good pair of comfortable walking shoes. Without access to a car or public transportation [@country], you may have to do quite a bit of walking. Break in your shoes before you go.</li>
            <li><strong>Emergency Contacts:</strong> Keep your program staff and your emergency contacts at home and [@country] well informed of your whereabouts and activities, and provide these people with copies of your important travel documents (i.e. passport, visa, plane tickets, traveler's checks, and prescriptions, etc.).</li>
            <li><strong>Air Travel:</strong> When you travel by air, drink a lot of non&ndash;alcoholic fluids, stay away from caffeine, eat light, and stretch often to avoid jetlag. Many airlines are now required to show an in&ndash;flight video of stretching exercises you can do on the plane in order to avoid the potential formation of blood clots, which can be caused by cabin pressure. A direct flight is usually easier for most travelers, but flights broken up by stops can also lessen jet lag.</li>
            <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> Accidents involving in&ndash;country travel, whether by air, bus, train, taxi, car, etc., are a major cause of injury to students abroad. It is important to understand what the safe modes of travel are [@country] and in the countries to which you plan to travel. For more information on transportation [@country], please visit the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/travel/" target="_blank">U.S. Department of State</a>.

                <p>For more health and safety information about driving abroad, the <a href="http://www.asirt.org/" target="_blank">Association for Safe International Road Travel</a> offers road travel reports, seasonal hazards, safety tips and common driver behaviors for travel abroad.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Alcohol and Drugs:</strong> Use and abuse of alcohol and drugs abroad can increase the risk of accident and injury. Many study abroad accidents and injuries are related to the use and abuse of alcohol and drugs abroad. Violating drug laws [@country] may result in very serious consequences. In some countries you may visit, being found guilty of violating drug laws can result in consequences as serious as death.</li>
            <li><strong>Setting an Example:</strong> Set a good example. Remember you are like an ambassador for your U.S. college or university, as well as your culture and country. Behave in a way that is respectful of others' rights and well&ndash;being and encourage others to do the same.</li>
