        <p>In this section, you will learn how to communicate better with a program's administration, family and friends while you are in [@country]. When looking at a study abroad program in [@country], see if it has a 24&ndash;hour communication contact person both in [@country] and in the United States. With the advent of the "information age," there now exists more than just one way to communicate internationally.</p>

        <h2><a name="section1"></a>1. General Information</h2>
        <p>The U.S. Department of State offers the following additional information on Communication in [@country]. For more complete information, please visit the <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/index.htm">Department of State</a>.</p>
        <div class="communication_list">
            <!-- list of communications -->
            <div>
                <!-- Free online video calls -->
                <p><strong>Free Online Video Calls:</strong> The most common way that students and loved ones keep in touch is through online video calls, which are offered by a number of programs and should be free as long as both parties have access to the program from their computers or mobile devices. Video calls are satisfying for both families and students to bridge the long-distance gap during a student's time abroad.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <!-- email -->
                <img alt="email" src="images/country_img/communications_email.gif" style="float:left; margin:4px;" />
                <p><strong>E&ndash;Mail:</strong> Electronic Mail is probably the least expensive and easiest method of communication for people in different time zones.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <!-- cellular phone -->
                <img alt="cellular phone" src="images/country_img/communications_cell.gif" style="float:left; margin:4px;" />
                <p><strong>Cellular Phone/ Landline Phone:</strong> Cellular phones have become more common and less expensive around the world. Although local calls may be inexpensive, international calls may have a high cost. If your program is a semester-long or more, it may be helpful to purchase a prepaid phone in the country of your choice. Phone cards can also be purchased in some countries to refill minutes if you run low. </p>
                <div class="program-tip">
                    <p><img src="images/country_img/tip1.png" border="0" width="50" align="left"> <span>You can use international calling cards from your cell phone! Make sure you check your available minutes.</span></p>
                </div>
                <p>It is important to know the telephone numbers for the program administration in the country of your choice and in the United States both during business hours and in case of an emergency. A regular telephone number may be provided to you while in the country of your choice, so be sure to relay this information to your contacts at home if they need to reach you or your program administrator. The sample <a href="../emergency-card.php?country=General">Emergency Card</a> includes phone numbers that you should have with you at all times. Some U.S. phones with international capabilities can also be used in the country of your choice if you choose to bring it from home as well. </p>
                <p>For calls <em><strong>from</strong></em> the U.S., the caller must dial the U.S. exit code, "011". Each country has a country code, which is then followed by the local number, which may also require an area code. For example, a call to a landline in the United Kingdom from the U.S. would be dialed 011-44-??-????-????. The number of digits may vary, especially if you are calling from a cellular phone. </p>
                <p>For calls <em><strong>to</strong></em> the U.S., the caller must dial the local exit code, which may vary. The number is usually "0" or "00". Again, this may vary depending on whether the call is made from a landline or a cell phone.

            </div>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Texting:</strong> Cellular phones have become more common and less expensive around the world. Although local calls may be inexpensive, international calls may have a high cost. Short text messages sent from a cell phone may be a less expensive way to communicate internationally, provided the person you are messaging can receive text messages on his/her cell phone. Some multi&ndash;band phones that can be used in the United States can also be used in the country of your choice.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <!-- international calling card -->
                <img alt="international calling card" src="images/country_img/communications_card.gif" style="float:left; margin:4px;" />
                <p><strong>International Calling Cards:</strong> The most reasonable way to communicate between [@country] and the United States may be through the use of an international calling card, available through various companies/providers. You can also purchase calling cards in [@country].</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p><strong>Social Networking:</strong> Students in study abroad programs often post their photos on social networking sites to share amongst their program's peers and with those at home. Sharing pictures and posting highlights from time abroad can be a cherished keepsake both during and after students complete their program. Social networking is also the most popular way that students keep in touch with other program participants later on. Some networking sites have chatting capabilities as well.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <!-- fax -->
                <img alt="fax" src="images/country_img/communications_fax.gif" style="float:left; margin:4px;" />
                <p><strong>Fax:</strong> In case phoning is not possible, a program&#39;s offices in the United States and in [@country] may have a fax machine available for communication.</p>
            </div>
            <div> <img alt="snail mail" src="images/country_img/communications_mail.gif" style="float:left; margin:4px;" />
                <p><strong>Mail:</strong> (Regular or Express): Postcards and letters are still an important and inexpensive method of communication. For those documents that need to get there faster, there are many companies that provide fast international mail delivery. Before you go abroad, it is important to find out the mailing address for both your program&#39;s administrative offices in the United States and in [@country], as well as your own mailing address (at your residence or administrative office when available). The national mail system of [@country] and other countries may not be as fast as the U.S. mail service, so allow for extra time when mailing from abroad.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <!-- Wireless PDA Device -->
                <img alt="wireless PDA device" src="images/country_img/communications_pda.gif" style="float:left; margin:4px;" />
                <p><strong>Wireless/PDA Device:</strong> Known as Personal Data Assistants or PDAs, and other wireless communication devices may be another way to communicate while in [@country]. You will need to ensure that the device you purchase in the United States will work while you are in [@country].</p>
            </div>
            <div> <img alt="satellite phone" src="images/country_img/communications_satellite.gif" style="float:left; margin:4px;" />
                <p><strong>Satellite Phone:</strong> Although still a very expensive alternative to regular or cell phones, satellite phones may be an effective method of communication in parts of [@country] where communication is extremely difficult, or in the case of emergencies.</p>
