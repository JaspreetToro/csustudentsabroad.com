        <h2><a name="section1"></a>1.  Overview of the U.S. Educational System</h2>
        <p>With over 3,000 universities and programs to choose from, selecting just one may be a difficult process! In this section, you will get some helpful tools and advice on how to select the best program for you.</p>
        <p>[@highlightedOpportunityDescription]</p>
        <p>Prior to participating, you and your parents should take time to look at the different programs available for your U.S. study.</p>
        <p>It will be helpful to your search if you understand the structure of the U.S. Educational system, which may be very different from that of your home country. Admission to undergraduate and graduate programs in particular will require you to have completed a particular level of education at the time of admission. It is important that you realize that not all U.S. programs are the same. Some programs are extremely demanding and the workload can even be difficult for American students. Other programs are more relaxed and focus on connecting students in cross&ndash;cultural learning. Before making a decision, it is important that you know how challenging your program will be. </p>
        <h2><a name="section2"></a>2.  Understanding the U.S. Educational System</h2>
        <p>(The following content detailing the U.S. education system was adapted from <a href="http://www.conversa1.com">http://www.conversa1.com</a>. Refer to the web site for more information)</p>
        <p>Today, over 400,000 students non-U.S. residents are studying in the United States. They come from almost every country in the world. As you might imagine, all students have their own educational goals. Therefore, it is important to understand the U.S. educational system so that you select the right program for you.</p>
        <h3>Levels of Education:</h3>
        <p>The levels of education in the U.S. are similar to those in other countries. But the differences can be confusing to non-U.S. residents. Below are some definitions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary Education:</strong> Pre-school: ages 2 - 6; Elementary School: ages 6-12.</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Education:</strong> Junior High School: ages 12-14; High School: ages 14-18 (note that everyone in the U.S. is required by law to attend until the age of 16. However, some students "drop-out" and do not complete their high school degree.</li>
            <li><strong>Post Secondary Education:</strong> There are no real age categories for post secondary education. Generally, American students start college right after completing high school (about 60% of all students who graduate from high school enter college at some point in their life). Junior and Technical colleges are designed to be two year programs, while universities and colleges are designed to be 4 year programs at the undergraduate level. In reality, the average American takes over 6 years to finish a "4 year degree". The reason is that more than 50% of college freshmen (first year students) do not know what major or specialization they wish to study. Also, many students work to pay for their college expenses. Thus they may take fewer classes in order to work. </li>
            <li><strong>College versus University:</strong> A college usually just has a Bachelor&#39;s (4 year) program. A university may be composed of several colleges (for example, the college of medicine and the college of engineering). Universities often have graduate programs as well. For most purposes, a Bachelor&#39;s degree from a college is equivalent to a Bachelor&#39;s degree from a university, so that the words "college" and "university" mean the same thing to most Americans. Generally, the value of a degree is a reflection of how society views the particular college or university.</li>
            <li><strong>Vocational/Technical School:</strong> Vocational and technical schools operate at either the high school or junior college level. They teach skills such as secretarial, auto mechanics, photography, nursing, etc. It is often difficult for non-U.S. residents to find information on U.S. technical and vocational schools since these schools usually do not promote their programs outside the area where they operate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Post Secondary Education category could be listed as follows:</p>

        <h4>Public and Private Institutions</h4>
        <p>There are public and private colleges, schools and universities in the United States. The public schools are funded, in part, by a city, and/or state, and/or federal government. Students living in the city or state pay less tuition because some tax money is used to subsidize the tuition. Non-U.S. residents would pay more, since they would not be residents of the city or state where the college or university is located.</p>
        <p>Private colleges and universities are supported primarily by tuition and private contributions. All students must pay the same tuition no matter where they are from (unless they get a grant or scholarship). Many private schools are affiliated with a religion. Examples are Roman Catholic, Protestant, Islamic and Jewish religions. Students at these schools do not have to be of that particular religion to attend, but they may be required to take certain religious or theological courses pertaining to that religion. Consult each college&#39;s catalogue.</p>
        <h4>English Language Programs</h4>
        <p>If your English skills are very limited, you may need to attend an English language institute before beginning your degree program. Alternatively, you can also select a university that offers an English-as-a-second-language (ESL) program.</p>
        <p>These programs are typically privately owned, although some operate on a college or university campus. They offer both private, one-on-one, and group instruction in English, TOEFL preparation, and other programs.</p>
        <p>If you wish to study English before you enter an American college, you may want to study at a private English language center. There, you can improve your English, better your study skills, or prepare for the TOEFL test. This will also give you the opportunity to evaluate colleges and universities in the United States by visiting them personally, and speaking to Americans who may be more familiar with the universities and programs that are best for you. You will also be able to become more familiar with American culture before you start your university program.</p>
        <p>If you have any more questions concerning the American education system, contact your English teacher, library, Educational Advising Center, American consulate, or nearest university in your country. </p>
        <div class="program-tip">
            <p><img src="images/country_img/tip1.png" border="0" width="50" align="left"> <span>You can still get to a great university even if your English skills are not great at this point. The important thing to remember is to have confidence in yourself and to really put effort into learning the language! </span></p>
        </div>
        <h2><a name="section3"></a>3.  Types of Education</h2>
        <p>After you identify what&#39;s important to you, do a university search. You can use various search tools to search for the U.S. University that best suits your needs.</p>
        <p>It is important that you remember that in the United States, students begin collegiate studies after completing 12 years of primary and secondary school. Students can study at two-year colleges, known as community or junior colleges, four-year colleges, universities, vocational and technical schools, and professional schools such as law and medical schools. Size varies too. At some universities the student body is as small as 1,000 students. Large universities may enroll 50,000 or more students.</p>
        <p>Check out a description of the U.S. Educational System for more information.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Undergraduate Education </strong><br />
                Most students complete a bachelor&#39;s degree in four years. At most institutions those years are known as the freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior years of undergraduate study. Some students attend a junior or community college for two years and earn an associate s degree. Some opt to transfer to a four-year college or university to complete two more years of coursework to earn a bachelor&#39;s degree.<br />
                <br />
                Typically students have the opportunity to study in various fields such as social sciences, humanities, and natural or physical sciences. By the end of the second year, students at many institutions are asked to choose a specific field of study, known as a major. Generally, students focus on their major during the last two years of their undergraduate program. Check out details about undergraduate education <a href="http://educationusa.state.gov/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Graduate Education</strong><br />
                Master&#39;s degrees are the most frequently awarded graduate degrees. Typically, students spend one to three years completing a Master&#39;s program. The most common graduate degrees include the master&#39;s of arts (MA), sciences (MS), business administration (MBA), fine arts (MFA), law (LLM), social work (MSW), and specialist in education (EdS). Some students also pursue doctorates (PhD). For details about graduate studies, click <a href="http://educationusa.state.gov/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>Doctorate students</strong> usually complete their program in five to seven years of study following receipt of the bachelor&#39;s degree. Research is a focal point of most U.S. graduate programs. Most doctorate programs require students to write a dissertation involving original research. The dissertation may involve a year or more of research and usually a year of writing.

        </ol>
        <h2><a name="section4"></a>4.  Time Factor</h2>
        <p>Don&#39;t miss the opportunity to study in the U.S. by not beginning the process on time! The earlier you start researching programs, the better chance you will have to fulfill all the admission requirements and submit your application on time. One of the simplest ways to find an appropriate study program in the United States is to ask professors at local universities which U.S. programs or colleges they recommend. Chances are that some of your current or old teachers may have studied in the U.S. themselves. You also need to take the time to ask yourself why you want to study in the U.S. What are your goals? Which U.S degrees does your home country&#39;s government recognize? Which fields of study may lead you to a good job after you graduate? As an overseas applicant, you face a special challenge because you may have never visited the United States or any of the universities to which you may want to apply. This means that you must make the time to find out about university locations, size, and social life.</p>
        <h2><a name="section5"></a>5.  Some Tools for Finding a Program</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Office for International Students/Resource Center:</strong> It would be worth your time to try to meet with a trained advising counselor. Most advising centers are usually sponsored by (1) the U.S. government, (2) a joint partnership between the U.S. government and a local university, or (3) by a non-profit international educational organization. Advising centers are a great resource because most have libraries with recent catalogs and video from U.S. universities. The advisors that work at these centers usually know the U.S. educational system well and should be able to help you answer questions about the admission process, including admissions tests. Chances are that your university has such an advisor, or may be able to refer you to someone else. You could also locate a private counselor who lives in your local city. To find a resource center in your home country, click <a href="http://www.intstudy.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

        <h2><a name="section6"></a>6.  Asking the Right Questions</h2>
        <p>The following is a list of questions to ask when looking for an appropriate study program in the United States. Along with speaking with an educational advisor, it is suggested that you ask to speak to students who studied at the university in the past. If possible, speak directly with one of the university&#39;s representatives in the United States to find out the strengths and weaknesses of the program and the university. Making the right choice of a course and college in any foreign country is fraught with difficulties. However, it is one of the most important decisions that you will have to make, and the ability to answer the following 10 questions accurately, should go some way to helping you with this.(Source: <a href="http://www.intstudy.com/" target="_blank">http://www.intstudy.com/</a>)
