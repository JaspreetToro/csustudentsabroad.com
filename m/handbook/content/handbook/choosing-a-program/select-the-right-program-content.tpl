        <p>The following things are some personal factors that can affect a student&#39;s program decision:</p>
        <h2><a name="section1"></a>1.  Affordability and Finances</h2>
        <p><img src="images/country_img/program_cash.gif" alt="cash" style="float:left; margin:4px;" /><strong>Cost:</strong> Finding a quality program that&#39;s affordable is possible. Depending on you or your family&#39;s financial situation, program cost may or may not be an issue for you. No one wants to compromise quality for cost. However, many students need to find programs that fit their personal budget. Costs for study abroad programs don&#39;t end with a basic fee; rather, additional costs can add up for insurance, housing, meals, excursions, travel, medical needs and purchases.</p>
        <p><strong>Spending and Saving:</strong> Frugal spending is key both before you go, and while you are in [@country]. Make a budget for yourself and stick to it. Before you go, you may want to budget your spending by giving up that morning cup of coffee you buy on your way to work/class. Instead, you could make your own coffee at home, and bring your lunch with you rather than buying it every day. You may have to eat out less and give up going out as frequently. You could take the bus instead of paying to fill up your car, and you might even start clipping coupons.</p>
        <h2><a name="section2"></a>2.  Size Does Matter</h2>
        <p><strong>Group Size:</strong> Some study abroad programs have very high limits for enrollment, while others are very selective about the number of students they allow to participate. You should determine in which situation you might feel more comfortable.</p>

        <p>It is important to ask your study abroad program coordinator what the ratio is between staff and students&ndash;a small program staff in charge of a large group may not be the best when you are trying to find someone to assist you. Of course, if you plan to do independent study, you may very well be the only U.S. student at the institution you&#39;ve chosen. This would probably give you the highest level of immersion, but you would have added responsibilities that another student studying in a program group may not have.</p>
        <p><strong>Class Size:</strong> Depending on how you learn best as a student, you will want to choose a program with smaller or larger class size. As a student, you may enjoy smaller class sizes because of the personal attention you receive. Also, if you are a beginning&ndash;level [@countryPrimaryLanguage] learner, you may appreciate the extra help that smaller classes can provide. On the other hand, you may be comfortable and accustomed to larger classes in which you have more independent study time. You may enjoy a larger class setting where you may come in contact with more students. Ask your study abroad program coordinator what the average class size tends to be for the subjects you will take in [@country].</p>

        <h2><a name="section4"></a>4.  Your Objectives</h2>
        <p>Goals: Everyone chooses to study abroad for different reasons. You may want to learn or improve your [@countryPrimaryLanguage]. You may want to conduct independent research. You may want to pursue a degree, or you may just want to travel and get away. Before choosing a program, see if it fits the personal goals and objectives you have. Ask yourself if the program you choose will allow you to accomplish what you have in mind.</p>
