Regardless of your language proficiency level, there are a few basic words, phrases, and questions that you should be able to pronounce fluently.

The card contains a series of simple images that represent services you may requireâ€”services like a telephone, post&ndash;office, taxi, and hospital. If you don&#39;t remember, or don&#39;t know, how to say a certain word in [@countryPrimaryLanguage], you can point to the picture on the card that represents that word. For example, if you need to find a telephone, you can show someone the picture of a telephone on the card and they can assist you. It is better to already be able to comfortably communicate in [@countryPrimaryLanguage] when studying in [@country]. However, you should keep this card with you just in case you forget how to say a certain word, or, in the case of injury, you become physically unable to verbally communicate.</p>
