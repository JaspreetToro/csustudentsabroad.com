        <p>We, the participants in the Global Dialogue, hosted by the &lsquo;International Education Association of South Africa&rsquo; (IEASA) on 15 -17 January 2014 in Port Elizabeth, representing nine national, six regional and nine other organisations from around the world, with national, regional and global responsibilities, declare our commitment to emphasise the importance of decision-making and practices in the development of internationalisation activities that are imbued with ethical considerations and inclusivity.</p>
        <p>We recognize the importance of two recently published documents:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><em>Affirming Academic Values in Internationalization of Higher Education:</em></strong> A Call for Action, adopted by the &lsquo;International Association of Universities&rsquo; (IAU), April 2012.<br />
                <a href="http://www.iau-aiu.net/sites/all/files/Affirming_Academic_Values_in_Internationalization_of_Higher_Education.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.iau-aiu.net/sites/all/files/Affirming_Academic_Values_in_Internationalization_of_Higher_Education.pdf</a></li>
            <li><strong><em>International Student Mobility Charter</em></strong>, adopted by the &lsquo;European Association for International Education&rsquo; (EAIE) and the &lsquo;International Education Association of Australia&rsquo; (IEAA) in association with other like-minded associations around the world, September 2012.<br />
                <a href="http://www.eaie.org/home/in-the-field/policy-advocacy/international-student-mobility-charter" target="_blank">http://www.eaie.org/home/in-the-field/policy-advocacy/international-student-mobility-charter</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In formulating action steps that give expression to implement the contents framed in these documents, we wish to reemphasise that internationalization must be based on mutual benefit and development for entities and individuals in the developed, emerging and developing countries.</p>
        <p>The Dialogue participants commit themselves to promote international higher education and research that recognises the richness and diversity offered by all regions for a global higher education agenda which is equitable, ethical, socially responsible, accessible and accountable.</p>
        <p>The Dialogue participants agree that the future agenda for internationalisation should in particular concentrate on the following three integrated areas of development:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><em>Enhancing the quality and diversity in programmes involving the mobility of students and academic and administrative staff;</em></strong></li>
            <li><strong><em>Increasing focus on the internationalization of the curriculum and of related learning outcomes;</em></strong></li>
            <li><strong><em>Gaining commitment on a global basis to equal and ethical higher education partnerships.</em></strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The following high priority and priority action steps have been collectively agreed upon:</p>
        <p><strong>High Priority Actions</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Action 1:</strong> The three integrated areas mentioned above shall be the core elements of joint professional development of our constituencies so as to guarantee global interaction and dialogue and optimisation of these activities.</li>
            <li><strong>Action 2:</strong> The organisations affiliated to the &lsquo;Network of International Education Associations&rsquo; (NIEA) will, before the end of 2014, explore plans to increase access to conferences and other professional development activities, as well as providing discounted membership for the members of each other&rsquo;s associations, especially for individuals from the developing and emerging countries.</li>
            <li><strong>Action 3:</strong> The organisations present at the Global Dialogue affiliated to the &lsquo;Association for Studies in International Education&rsquo; (ASIE) shall, at the ASIE meeting on 1 April 2014 propose plans to encourage both co-research and coauthorships between researchers from emerging and developing countries as well as opportunities around the dissemination of research through a range of academic publications.</li>
            <li><strong>Action 4:</strong> A Global Dialogue shall be organised every two years under the guidance of the NIEA. The next Global Dialogue will take place in 2016.</li>
            <li><strong>Action 5:</strong> In line with the IAU statement, the Global Dialogue participants commit themselves to apply ethical standards to their own activities and urge their members or constituencies to do likewise.</li>
            <li><strong>Action 6:</strong> By September 2014, a set of International Partnership guidelines shall be developed and proposed for adoption by organisations affiliated with the NIEA to ensure equal and ethical practices in international education.</li>
            <li><strong>Action 7:</strong> The IAU shall broaden their existing database of International Higher Education experts to include volunteers who are members of other internationalisation entities to offer their expertise for purposes of professional development by the end of 2014. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Priority Actions</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Action 8: The organisations present at the Global Dialogue shall stimulate broader and diverse active participation and ensure that the outcomes of the Global Dialogue are taken into consideration in the regular IAU Global Survey.</li>
            <li>Action 9: The NIEA shall stimulate and support the development of a global network of organisations and centres that conduct research on international higher education and will organise a forum within the next two years in a developing or emerging country focused on inter-regional research in this field.</li>
            <li>Action 10: The organisations belonging to NIEA shall explore plans to restructure its activities into working groups and action-oriented meetings. The upcoming NIEA meeting at the AIEA and NAFSA 2014 conferences shall discuss this new structure. In addition to AIEA, NAFSA and EAIE conferences, they need to explore how every other strategic conference can be used for these types of action-oriented meetings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The organisations in the Global Dialogue commit themselves to assess the progress of the implementation of the actions agreed upon in this declaration on an annual basis. They will also create an online portal through which the NIEA can share the two previously mentioned documents and where other organisations can share similar documents or charters (if possible in different languages) in order to make the information accessible to a wide variety of stakeholders.</p>
        <p>The participants commit to inform their constituencies and those of similar entities in the fields of international and higher education that were not present at this Dialogue of the above declaration and to actively gain support for the implementation of the actions agreed upon in this declaration.</p>
