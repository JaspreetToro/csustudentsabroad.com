        <h2><a name="section1"></a>1. General Information</h2>
        <p>Not knowing local laws can get you into serious trouble. Just because something is legal in your home country doesn't mean it is legal in the United States. Most students who study in the U.S. do not break laws on purpose; instead, they end up doing something illegal without knowing it. Even as an international student, you must obey all U.S laws.</p>
        <p>If you break laws in the United States, your home country's government can do very little to help you. You are granted no special privileges or rights, and will be dealt with according to standard procedure of the U.S. legal system. The U.S. government encourages all visitors to become familiar with local laws before they visit. Upon arrival in the United States, you may also wish to ask an U.S. official about local laws and procedures.</p>
        <p>For more complete information on the U.S. legal issues listed below, visit the official website of the <a href="http://www.state.gov/s/l/">U.S. Department of State</a><img class="img" src="images/country_img/laws_gavel.gif" align="right"></p>

            <li><b>Embassy or Consulate Assistance:</b> If you find yourself in legal trouble (for example, arrested) in the United States, your home country's <a href="http://www.embassy.org/embassies/#b">Embassy or Consulate</a> may only be able to assist you in the following ways:

            <li><strong>Drinking Laws</strong>: <em class="titleColor"><strong>The legal age for alcohol in the USA is 21 years old.</strong></em> The National Minimum Drinking Age Act of1984 required all states to raise their minimum purchase and public possession of alcohol age to 21. States that did not comply faced a reduction in highway funds under the Federal Highway Aid Act. The U.S. Department of Transportation has determined that all states are in compliance with this act. The national law specifically prohibits purchase and public possession of alcoholic beverages. It does not prohibit persons under 21 (also called youth or minors) from drinking. The term "public possession" is strictly defined and does not apply to possession for the following:
                <ul type="disc">
                    <li>An established religious purpose, when accompanied by a parent, spouse or legal guardian age 21 or older </li>
                    <li>Medical purposes when prescribed or administered by a licensed physician, pharmacist, dentist, nurse, hospital or medical institution </li>
                    <li>In private clubs or establishments </li>
                    <li>In the course of lawful employment by a duly licensed manufacturer, wholesaler or retailer (Source: <a href="http://www.mudpc.org/laws.html" target="_blank">http://www.mudpc.org/laws.html</a>)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Any time you want to purchase an alcoholic beverage, you will be asked for a valid ID (some establishments do not consider a non-U.S. passport for a valid ID). Familiarize yourself <a href="http://www2.potsdam.edu/hansondj/StateAndLocalLaws/index.html">here</a> with the laws in all U.S. states as you may save yourself from an incident jeopardizing your future! </p>
