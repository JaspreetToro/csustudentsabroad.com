       <h2><a name="section1"></a>1.  General Information</h2>
        <p>Not knowing local laws can get you into serious trouble. Just because something is legal in the United States doesn't mean it is legal in [@country]. Most students who study abroad do not break the law on purpose; instead, they end up doing something illegal without knowing it. Even as a foreigner, you must obey all [@nationality1] laws and the laws of other countries to which you are traveling.</p>
        
        <p><img src="images/country_img/laws_gavel.gif" alt="gavel" style="float:right; margin:4px;" />If you break local laws while in [@country], the U.S. government can do very little to help you. You are granted no special privileges or rights, and will be dealt with according to standard procedure of the legal system of [@country]. The U.S. and [@nationality1] governments encourage all visitors to [@country] to become familiar with local laws before they visit. Upon arrival in [@country], you may also wish to ask [@nationality2] official about local laws and procedures. Remember, most students who study abroad wind up breaking the law unintentionally, and alcohol or drug use has been associated with law&ndash;breaking in many cases.</p>
        <p>For more complete information on [@nationality1] laws and the [@nationality1] legal system, visit the official website of the <a href="http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/">U.S. Department of State</a>.</p>
