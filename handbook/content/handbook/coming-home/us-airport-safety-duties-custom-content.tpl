            <li style="list-style: none"><img src="images/country_img/airport_plane.gif" alt="airplane" style="float:right; margin:4px; width: 110px;" /></li>
            <li><strong>Showing Identification:</strong> Try to always have your passport easily accessible, yet protect it against theft. Be prepared to show your passport when presenting your airline tickets/receiving boarding passes, entering departure gates, going through passport control, when boarding flights, etc.</li>
            <li style="list-style: none"><img src="images/country_img/passport.gif" alt="passport" style="float:right; margin:4px; width: 100px;" /></li>
            <li><strong>Carry&ndash;on Luggage:</strong> Check with your airline to find out its regulations for what you can and cannot pack in your carry&ndash;on bags. Do not put any sharp objects like nail scissors, razors, or pocket knives in your carry&ndash;on. Such items may be considered a threat to safety and could be taken away from you. Pack them in your checked baggage instead.</li>
            <li><strong>Accepting Things from Others:</strong> Under no circumstances, should you ever take anything from, or hold anything for, anyone who asks you to do so. If anyone does ask you, simply say "no" and walk away. Don't be afraid to say "no" to family and friends. You need to think about the potential consequences before you hold anything for anyone.</li>
            <li><strong>Watching Your Bags:</strong> Your bags should be in your sight at the airport up to point when you check them at the airline counter. Once you have picked up your bags from baggage claim, and are on your way to customs, be sure to keep a close eye on all your luggage so that no one but you has access to it.</li>
            <li style="list-style: none"><img src="images/country_img/airport_bags.gif" alt="bags" style="float:right; margin:4px;" /></li>
            <li><strong>Random Baggage Searches:</strong> If you are stopped and asked to open your luggage, cooperate with the customs officials. Customs officials often conduct random baggage searches; just because your luggage gets searched, doesn't mean you have done something wrong.</li>
            <li><strong>Body Searches:</strong> Airport security officials may conduct random body searches using an electronic device they wave over you. In some cases, a security official of the same sex as you may conduct a body search using his or her hands, and/or ask you to remove your shoes for inspection.</li>
            <li><strong>Distractions:</strong> Airports are full of people carrying cash, travelers&#39; checks, credit cards, passports and other valuable documents. Therefore, airports tend to be an active place for thieves. While your attention is focused on checking in, boarding, getting your bags, finding a restroom, etc., you can become an easy target for theft. Be alert to anyone who suspiciously tries to distract you by asking directions, knocking over your coffee, reaching under a bathroom stall, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><a name="section2"></a>2.  Duties and Customs Declarations</h2>
        <p>Customs control regulations may affect what you can and cannot bring in and out of [@country]. Following the events of September 1, 2001, US airport and customs security has become much stricter, leading to long waits prior to boarding your plane, body searches, a necessary early arrival time and questions from officials in both countries. Remember to be patient and be honest when answering all officials' questions. The following information from the U.S. Department of State discusses border issues in more depth. For more complete information on border and Environmental Affairs between the United States and [@country], please visit the U.S. Customs and Border Protections Agency.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clearing Customs:</strong> Follow the directions given to you by flight attendants and your program for the process of clearing customs.</li>
            <li><strong>Declaration Forms:</strong> In most cases, you will be given a card to fill out that will require your passport information, items you have purchased in [@country] and are bringing back into the country, and the cost of these items.</li>
            <li><strong>Receipt of Purchase:</strong> Retain all receipts, or make an itemized list of purchases, prior to customs inspection.</li>
            <li><strong>Taxes:</strong> If the total cost of your purchases exceeds a certain amount, you will be asked to pay a tax on all items over the allotted amount.</li>
            <li><strong>Items You Cannot Bring Into the United States:</strong> The following is a general list of items that cannot be brought into the United States from [@country] or from anywhere else:
                <ul>
                    <li>Plants, animals (especially those on lists of endangered species), and all live birds, unless you have a valid certificate or license from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</li>
                    <div class="sm_quote_r"><blockquote><span class="red">Remember to be patient and be honest when answering all border officials' questions</span></blockquote></div>
                    <li>Drugs&mdash;even if a drug was legal in [@country] or other countries, it may not be legal to bring it back to the United States.

                    <li>Firearms, knives, explosives, and gas canisters.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Items You Can Bring Into the United States:</strong> There are limits on bringing in substances that are not illegal, such as alcohol or tobacco. Check with customs for updates on these legal quantities. Even if a minor can purchase alcohol and tobacco in [@country] or other countries, he or she cannot bring these substances back into the United States.</li>
            <li><strong>Smuggling:</strong> What may be legal in [@country] and in other countries may not be legal in the United States, and vice versa. Smuggling can be a federal offense leading to fines or imprisonment.</li>
        </ul>
