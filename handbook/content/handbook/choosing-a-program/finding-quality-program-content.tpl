        <p>Prior to participating, students and their parents should take time to look at the different programs available for study abroad. One of the main reasons students cite for not studying abroad is that they start the planning process too late and miss the opportunity. The earlier you start researching programs, the better chance you will have to study abroad, include the coursework in your on&ndash;campus degree program, and graduate on time. The simplest way to find an appropriate study abroad program in [@country] is to look at programs available through your home campus; home campus faculty and staff can help you through the process.</p>
