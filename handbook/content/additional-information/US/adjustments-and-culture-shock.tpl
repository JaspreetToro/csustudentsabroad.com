        <h2><a name="section6"></a>6.  Checklist</h2>
        <ul class="checklists">
            <li>I am already familiar with some major cultural differences between home and the country in which I will study (i.e.: religion, language, laws)?</li>
            <li>I understand that it is normal to experience culture shock, including feelings of anxiety, depression and frustration.</li>
            <li>If my depression does not go away, I know where to get help (i.e.: a student counselor)?</li>
            <li>I expect to have both good days and bad when learning to overcome my culture shock, and I will be patient with myself as I learn to adapt.</li>
            <li>I know that I am not alone in how I feel.</li>
            <li>I will try not to be negative or overly critical of another country's culture. Instead, I will look for the positives that a culture possesses.</li>
            <li>I will make an effort to meet and make friends with locals rather than just hanging around other Americans.</li>
            <li>I will not let terrorist threats turn my culture shock into culture fear.</li>
  Upon return home, I will be patient with myself again as I experience reverse culture shock. (This includes trying not to be overly critical of the U.S. just because being home is not like being abroad.)</li>
