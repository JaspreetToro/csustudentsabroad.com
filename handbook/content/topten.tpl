                    <p><strong>Be Prepared to Respond to Emergencies</strong><br />
                        The more prepared you are for emergencies the better able you will be to respond. Where will you go if you need to leave the country? What will you do if you are a victim of a crime or are injured? What if someone else needs help?</p>

                    <p><strong>Avoid Crime and Violence, Including Sexual Harassment and Assault</strong><br />
                        Be aware of the safe and unsafe areas where you are living and traveling. Use your safety skills from the U.S. while abroad: don&#39;t travel or go out alone (buddy system), don&#39;t go into bad neighborhoods, be more careful at night, etc. Be aware of stereotypes of U.S. men and women and understand local verbal and non&ndash;verbal communication.</p>

                        Whether you are arranging your own transportation or you are being led by your program provider, look closely at what the safest type of transportation is for where you&#39;re going, what routes you&#39;re taking, and at what time you&#39;re traveling.</p>

                        Although alcohol may be legal at a younger age abroad, its use and abuse is many times tied to being a victim of crime, violence, accident, and injury. Drug use abroad can result in severe consequences&mdash;plan on being treated as guilty (in jail) until proven innocent outside the U.S.</p>

                    <p><strong>Choose a Quality Program Provider</strong><br />
